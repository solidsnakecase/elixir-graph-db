# Elixir Graph Database

## Description

I want to use graph databases in my future projects in Elixir involving machine learning. I already have built a modular bug bounty automation program that runs on Elixir using FLAME to incorporate serverless scaling for each of the modular processes, but I want to incorporate graph databases to make the program more efficient and to be able to run more complex machine learning algorithms on the data.

In particular I am interested in the relationship identification and analysis capabilities of graph databases. I want to be able to identify relationships between different data points and use that information to make predictions about future data points.

## Structure

- Umbrella App
- Quasi-modular trials of different graph databases
